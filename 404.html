<br/><strong>Nota Bene:</strong> In the spring of 2019, Tumblr terminated my account without cause or advance warning. In the aftermath, many links to my old blog posts were broken. Some have been fixed, most have not. You can probably find what you are looking for in the <a href="{{ site.url }}/archive.html">archive</a>.

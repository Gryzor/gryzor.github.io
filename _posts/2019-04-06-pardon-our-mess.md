Since [Tumblr decided to terminate my account without warning or explanation](https://twitter.com/jaredsinclair/status/1114596937737678855), I've decided it's past time to move my blog to something under my control. Unfortunately I don't have a backup of my old posts ready to go. In lieu of anything better, I'll fill my Jekyll queue with my favorite lorem ipsum alternative, the "Clipper Ships" poem from [Little Man Tate][tate].

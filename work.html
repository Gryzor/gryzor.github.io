<!--Android-->

<h2><a>Ookla/Speedtest</a></h2>
<p>I worked on the implementation of the new custom UI (the Gauge and all the associated
elements on screen), wrote dozens of Unit Tests (both JUnit and Espresso), and made sure the UI worked well
with RTL languages and over 30 other Locales.</p><br/><br/>

<h2><a>Starbucks US</a></h2>
<p>I was part of the team which implemented Mobile Ordering and Payment in the US, using a local
(embedded) RealmDB (now acquired by MongoDB).</p><br/><br/>

<h2><a>8tracks</a></h2>
<p> I was hired to improve their old 2.0 Android app and implement their new 3.x iOS UI/REST Apis. I learned
to integrate Chromecast, a MusicPlayer, playing music in the background, new APIs, etc.</p><br/><br/>

<h2><a>Disney</a></h2>
<p>Participated in various projects during different periods, mostly related to their cruise lines.</p><br/><br/>

<h2><a>Orion Labs</a></h2>
<p> A SF-Based company that does 2-way radio software and hardware. Extensive usage of advanced
RXJava patterns. I contributed to maintain and expand their existing Android app in various fronts including
expanding their test suite.</p><br/><br/>

<h2><a>Major League Baseball</a></h2>
<p>I worked on the library they embedded in their Ballpark app to allow customers to order
food from their seats, and later pick them at special Lockers in the stadiums. Their plan was to include in-seat
delivery, but it didn’t make the cut due to a backend issue.</p><br/><br/>

<h2><a>Rotunda Software</a></h2>
<p>A small SF-based startup. I created their Android native app to interact with their backend, so
users didn’t have to use a web-based version.</p><br/><br/>

<h2><a>Trulia</a></h2>
<p>A real-estate SF-Based company that wanted to build an app for their Realtors (not for end users).
Extensive usage of Google Maps APIs. I was part of their small team of Android contractors.</p><br/><br/>

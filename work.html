<h2><a href="http://github.com/overshare/overshare-kit">OvershareKit</a></h2>
<p><span class="date-stamp">OCTOBER 2013&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>OvershareKit is a soup-to-nuts, open-source sharing library for iOS. As I developed <a href="{{ site.url }}/archived-unread/">Unread</a>, I dreaded having to write tons of sharing code <a href="http://pillboxie.com">all</a> <a href="http://riposteapp.net">over</a> <a href="http://riposteapp.net/whisper/">again</a>, so I teamed up with <a href="http://twitter.com/justin">Justin Williams</a> and solved the problem once and for all. In a word, OvershareKit does everything: sharing to Twitter, App.net, and more; third-party account management including saving credentials to the Keychain; beautiful share sheets with full-color icons; customizable message compose screens with killer features like syntax highlighting as you type. Let us know if you’re using it in a project.</p><br/><br/>

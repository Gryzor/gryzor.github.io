<h2>What Microphone Do You Have?</h2>

A <a href="https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti/">Blue Yeti USB</a> hanging from a <a href="https://www.rode.com/accessories/stands/psa1">Rode Arm</a>, and the <a href="https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/accessories/">RADIUS III mount</a>. </p>

<p>I may have an older version of the &quot;mount&quot; since I brought it circa 2014 (if I correctly recall) but it looks very similar and if the newer has new features, I don&#39;t know what they are.</p>

<h3>Are you a &quot;content creator, youtuber, streamer, podcaster, etc.&quot; or do you record vocals with it?</h3>

<p>No and no; I have recorded vocals in the past with it, it&#39;s &quot;ok&quot;. (not mine)</p>

<h3>What do you use this setup for?</h3>

<p>Work calls (Slack, Teams).</p>

<h3>Is it good?</h3>

<p>Yes, it has a clear sound (as most condenser mics do) <strong>but it does pick ambient noise</strong> (whether it&#39;s voices, or mechanical keyboard clacks, or even a light tap on your desktop), so if you&#39;re in a noisy environment, I recommend you look for a different type of microphone.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I've been developing Android apps since 2011. </p>
<p>I like to work with smart people who value attention to detail and is willing to teach and learn; I prefer not to be the “smartest person in the room”.</p>
<p>I think there should always be early and often communication and not just when things don’t go as planned. I value transparency and openness to discusing any issues when they arise. Having worked in software development for over two decades, I believe the inability to address certain topics in an organization impairs good development at every level.</p>
<p>The phrase “Always be improving” is on point; you can’t do the best thing every time, but you can certainly learn from it for the next time. 
Refactoring is evil, but sometimes needed; rewriting is more often than not a bad idea.</p>

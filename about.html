<h2>About Jared Sinclair</h2>
<p>I’ve been an art student and a wannabe-theologian. I've slung screwdrivers around fixing Mac computers. I've also been a registered ICU nurse.</p>
<p>Now I’m an app designer and programmer. I'm an iOS engineer at <a href="http://bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a>. I suppose I’m also known for making stuff like <a href="/archived-unread/">Unread</a> and <a href="http://riposteapp.net">Riposte</a>. More stuff is always on the way.</p>
<p>Be wary of following a similarly contorted career path, if only for the student loans I’ve left in my wake. There are cheaper ways of ending up where one wants to be.</p>
<p>Desire takes care of itself. The hard part is figuring out what to want, and how to want it, without wanting it too much or too little, and without being paralyzed by someone else’s guilt.</p>
